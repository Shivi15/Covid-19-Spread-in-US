# Covid-19-Spread-in-US

Shift of Covid-19 hotspots during the course of the pandemic. Since covid-19 has impacted almost every part of the US, I had been interested in time-based animations like racing bar charts.

In this project, I've used two datasets: 

a. COVID-19 cases by U.S. county (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv)
b. Table of population data for each U.S. county (https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html#par_textimage)
